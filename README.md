============


About
-----

neo4j-client is a command shell (CLI) for Neo4j. It supports secure connections
to Neo4j server, sending of statements (including multiline statements),
persistent command history, and rendering of results to tables or CSV.

neo4j-client utilizes the [Bolt Network Protocol](https://boltprotocol.org), and
will work with any server that supports Bolt.

For more details, see [the project page](https://neo4j-client.net) and
the [FAQ](https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client/wiki/FAQ).

Enter commands or cypher statements at the prompt.

Commands always begin with a colon (:) and conclude at the end of the line,
for example `:help`. Statements do not begin with a colon (:), may span
multiple lines, are terminated with a semi-colon (;) and will be sent to
the Neo4j server for evaluation.

:quit                  Exit the shell
:connect '<url>'       Connect to the specified URL
:connect host [port]   Connect to the specified host (and optional port)

$
```

Evaluating source files, e.g.:

```console
$ cat query.cyp
:set echo
:export name='Emil'

// Create a person node if it doesn't exist
begin;
MERGE (:Person {name: {name}});
commit;

// return the total number of people
MATCH (n:Person)
RETURN count(n);
$
$ neo4j-client -u neo4j -p pass -o result.out -i query.cyp
$ cat result.out
+:export name='Emil'
+begin;
+MERGE (:Person {name: {name}});
Nodes created: 1
Properties set: 1
Labels added: 1
+commit;
+MATCH (n:Person)
 RETURN count(n);

libneo4j-client
---------------

libneo4j-client is a client library for Neo4j, written in C, and intended as a
foundation on which basic tools and drivers for various languages may be built.
libneo4j-client takes care of all the detail of establishing a session with a
Neo4j server, sending statements for evaluation, and retrieving results.

libneo4j-client provides a single C header file, `neo4j-client.h`, for
inclusion in source code using the libneo4j-client API. The API is described in
the [API Documentation](#api_documentation).

libneo4j-client can be included in your project by linking the library at
compile time, typically using the linking flags
`-lneo4j-client -lssl -lcrypto -lm`.  Alternatively, libneo4j-client ships with
a [pkg-config]( https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/pkg-config/)
description file, enabling you to obtain the required flags using
`pkg-config --libs libneo4j-client`.


API Documentation
-----------------

API documentation for the latest release is available at
[https://neo4j-client.net/doc/latest/neo4j-client\_8h.html](
[https://neo4j-client.net/doc/latest/neo4j-client_8h.html).

Documentation can be built using `make doc`, which will use doxygen to generate
documentation and output it into the `doc/` directory of the libneo4j-client
source tree. See [Building](#building) below.


Example
-------

```C
#include <neo4j-client.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    neo4j_client_init();

    /* use NEO4J_INSECURE when connecting to disable TLS */
    neo4j_connection_t *connection =
            neo4j_connect("neo4j://user:pass@localhost:7687", NULL, NEO4J_INSECURE);
    if (connection == NULL)
    {
        neo4j_perror(stderr, errno, "Connection failed");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    neo4j_result_stream_t *results =
            neo4j_run(connection, "RETURN 'hello world'", neo4j_null);
    if (results == NULL)
    {
        neo4j_perror(stderr, errno, "Failed to run statement");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    neo4j_result_t *result = neo4j_fetch_next(results);
    if (result == NULL)
    {
        neo4j_perror(stderr, errno, "Failed to fetch result");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    neo4j_value_t value = neo4j_result_field(result, 0);
    char buf[128];
    printf("%s\n", neo4j_tostring(value, buf, sizeof(buf)));

    neo4j_close_results(results);
    neo4j_close(connection);
    neo4j_client_cleanup();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```


Building
--------

To use neo4j-client or libneo4j-client, consider installation using the package
management system for your operating system (currently
[Mac OS X](#getting_started),
[Debian](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/libneo4j-client),
[Ubuntu](#getting_started),
[Fedora](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/home:cleishm/libneo4j-client?repository=Fedora_23),
[CentOS](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/home:cleishm/libneo4j-client?repository=CentOS_7) and
[openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/home:cleishm/libneo4j-client?repository=openSUSE_Tumbleweed)).

If neo4j-client is not available via your package management system,
please [download the latest release](
https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client/releases), unpack and then:

```console
$ ./configure
$ make clean check
$ sudo make install
```

libneo4j-client requires OpenSSL, although this can be disabled by invoking
configure with `--without-tls`.

neo4j-client also requires some dependencies to build, including
[libedit](http://thrysoee.dk/editline/) and
[libcypher-parser](https://git.io/libcypher-parser). If these are not available,
just the library can be built (without neo4j-client), by invoking configure
with `--disable-tools`.

Building from the GitHub repository requires a few extra steps. Firstly, some
additional tooling is required, including autoconf, automake and libtool.
Assuming these are available, to checkout from GitHub and build:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client.git
$ cd libneo4j-client
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make clean check
$ sudo make install
```

NOTE: Recent versions of Mac OS X ship without the OpenSSL header files, and
autoconf doesn't pick this up (yet). If you used the homebrew install method,
this will resolve the issue. If you're using Mac OS X, want to build manually
instead of using homebrew, and you get a build failure related to missing
openssl headers, try the following:

```console
$ brew install openssl
$ ./configure --with-libs=/usr/local/opt/openssl
$ make clean check
$ sudo make install
```

More detail about this workaround can be found via `brew info openssl`.
